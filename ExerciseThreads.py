"""
Modify the following example in order to transform the script into:

 1) a multi-threaded script
    (for instance you could create 5 threads each of them in charge of computing 20 factorials)
 2) a multi-process script
    (for instance you could create 5 processes each of them in charge of computing 20 factorials)
    
You could then try to determine the most efficient version with the help of the module timeit
